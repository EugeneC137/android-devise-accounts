android-devise-accounts
=============
This is a little starter package for authenticating Android users with a Rails backend using Devise token authentication.  This was modeled after an article explaining how to setup token authentication on an existing devise project. http://matteomelani.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/authentication-for-mobile-devices/
